      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a front-end developer with a solid understanding of web fundamentals and a focus on creating responsive, accessible, and well-structured websites.
        I enjoy translating design mockups into functional and visually polished websites using clean, maintainable code.
        My approach balances visual design, performance, and semantic HTML structure — ensuring a smooth experience for both users and developers.

        <li><strong>JavaScript (Vanilla)</strong> - adding interactivity, DOM manipulation, and simple dynamic behavior.</li>
